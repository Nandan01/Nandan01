### **Hi there 👋**
## **I’m Sukhnandan(she/her)** 
 - 🧚🏻‍♂ I am currently a junior pursuing a degree in computer science. 
 
 - 🌻 Throughout my coursework I have developed a passion to create technology that elevates others and adds value, perspective, or purpose to their lives. 

 - 💻 I primarly work as a front-end developer when doing projects however, I have recently dived into backend development. I'm currently in the process doing some fullstack projects. Feel free to reach out for project collaboration or to provide helpful resources! 

 - 🤗 Apart from CS, a few things about me - I love solving puzzles, creating “trippy” art pieces, and trying new ethnic food.
