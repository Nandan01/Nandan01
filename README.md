### **Hi there 👋**
## **I’m Sukhnandan(she/her)** 
 - 🧚🏻‍♂ I am currently a junior pursuing a degree in computer science. 
 
 - 🌻 Throughout my coursework I have developed a passion to create technology that elevates others and adds value, perspective, or purpose to their lives. 

 - 🦋 I am currently in the process of doing some fullstack projects. Feel free to reach out for project collaboration!

 - 🤗 Apart from CS, a few things about me - I love solving puzzles, creating “trippy” art pieces, trying new ethnic food, and dancing.
